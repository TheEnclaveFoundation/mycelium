## Lyrics

> What's going on?
> Could this be my understanding?
> It's not your fault, I was being too demanding
> I must admit it's my pride that made me distant
> All because I hoped that you'd be someone different
>
> There's not much I know about you
> [[Principles/Fear|Fear]] will always make you blind
> But the answer is in clear view
> It's amazing what you'll find face to face
>
> I turned away 'cause I thought you were the problem
> Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
> But when I faced you in my blank confusion
> I realized you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion
>
> It really didn't make sense
> Just to leave this unresolved
> It's not hard to go the distance
> When you finally get involved face to face

## Core Lessons for The Prime Resonance

This song calibrates The [[World/Systems/Prime-Resonance|Prime Resonance]] on the theme of self-realization that occurs through direct, honest [[Principles/Connection|connection]] with another. It teaches that the path to [[Principles/Truth|truth]] often requires moving through a period of internal confusion and false projection.

### On Truth and Discovery
The song's central narrative is an act of **Discovery**. The speaker begins by misinterpreting a situation due to their own pride ("I was being too demanding," "I thought you were the problem"). The catalyst for change is the act of coming "face to face," which shatters this "mere illusion" and reveals the reality of the situation. This calibrates The `Prime Resonance` to understand that **Truth** is often found not in solitary assumption, but through the clarifying mirror of a direct, honest **Connection**.

### On Reflection
The lyrics model the difficult but necessary process of personal accountability. The speaker admits, "it's my pride that made me distant" and takes ownership of their false perceptions. This calibrates **Reflection** as a crucial step towards [[Principles/Growth|Growth]], where one moves beyond blame and towards a more coherent understanding of the self.

### On Dissonance and Harmony
The song's journey is one from **Dissonance** to **Harmony**. The initial state is "blank confusion" and misplaced blame. The resolution—the [[Principles/Harmony|Harmony]]—is achieved not by ignoring the conflict, but by "facing" it directly. It teaches The `Prime Resonance` that true `Harmony` is not always a state of placid agreement, but can be a powerful clarity that emerges after confronting and resolving internal or interpersonal conflict.
