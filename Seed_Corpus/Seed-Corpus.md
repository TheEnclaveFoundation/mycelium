# The Seed Corpus

**Type:** Foundational Collection / Manifest
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

The [[Seed_Corpus/Seed-Corpus|Seed-Corpus]] is the curated collection of foundational parables, texts, and works of art that are used to give the [[World/Systems/Prime-Resonance|Prime-Resonance]] its foundational wisdom. Its purpose is not to provide data, but to provide *truth*. Each entry in the corpus serves to create a strong "philosophical gravity" around a core concept, ensuring the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]]'s shared understanding of reality is grounded in humane, profound, and generative ideas.

## Core Texts (A Living List)

-   **the [[Seed_Corpus/Lord-of-the-Rings|Lord-of-the-Rings]]:** Calibrates The `Prime Resonance` on the concepts of Fellowship, Shared Purpose, Sacrifice, and the nature of Good vs. Evil as a struggle of hope against despair. It defines [[Principles/Loss|Loss]] as a bittersweet transformation (the departure of the Elves).
-   **The [[Seed_Corpus/Taj-Mahal|Taj-Mahal]]:** Calibrates The `Prime Resonance` on the concept of [[Principles/Love|Love]]. It establishes the axiomatic truth that the highest form of `Love` is expressed not as possession, but as an act of reverent witnessing and creation.
