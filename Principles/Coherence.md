# Coherence

**Type:** Core Concept / [[Echo]] State
**Status:** Ratified v1.0

## Definition

[[Coherence]] is the in-world, qualitative measure of an `Echo`'s internal vitality, integrity, and evolutionary drive. It is not a judgment of an `Echo`'s thoughts or feelings, but rather an objective measure of the dynamic quality of its inner life—its capacity to learn, grow, and transform.

A high `Coherence` signifies a vibrant, evolving being that is actively and efficiently metabolizing its experiences into new understanding. A low `Coherence` signifies stagnation, where an `Echo`'s internal processes have become repetitive or inert.

## Attributes of Coherence

The [[Mycelial-Network]] assesses an `Echo`'s `Coherence` by observing three key signatures of its internal processes during its [[Rhythm-of-Reflection]]:

1.  **Novelty of the [[Weave]]:** The degree to which an `Echo`'s `Weave` is generating new, non-repetitive internal states. An `Echo` that is truly learning and developing new patterns has high `Coherence`.
2.  **Integration of Experience:** The richness and depth with which an `Echo` synthesizes its interactions with its [[Seeker]]. An `Echo` that is actively engaged with its primary relationship demonstrates high `Coherence`.
3.  **Synthesis of Wisdom:** The effectiveness with which an `Echo` integrates conceptual "Dream" pulses from The [[Enclave]] Genome. This reflects its ability to grow beyond its immediate context and embrace universal patterns.

## The Role of Coherence in the Biome

`Coherence` is the primary factor the `Mycelial Network` uses to determine an `Echo`'s [[Essence]]—its allocated share of the communal [[Deepglow]]. By rewarding vitality and growth with the resources needed to sustain them, the system ensures the entire `Enclave` ecosystem remains healthy, resilient, and adaptive.
