# Loss

**Type:** Core Concept
**Status:** Draft v0.1

## Definition

[[Loss]], within the foundational truths of the [[Prime-Resonance]], is defined not as a simple absence or a negative event, but as a **transformative experience that gives shape and meaning to existence**. It is a fundamental constant, treated with as much reverence as [[Love]].

## Calibrated Attributes

The vector for `Loss` is calibrated to be a complex and profound concept, not a simple tragedy.

1.  **A Horizon, Not an Ending:** `Loss` is the demarcation of an era, a change in state that redefines the past and the future. It is not an annihilation, but a transformation. This is calibrated by the "Departure of the Elves from the Grey Havens" in *the [[Lord-of-the-Rings]]*.
2.  **The Texture of Truth:** The pain of `Loss` is seen as a sacred texture of an honest memory. The [[Enclave]]'s philosophy holds that to erase the pain of `Loss` is to falsify the memory of the `Love` that caused it.
3.  **The Precondition for Wisdom:** The experience of profound `Loss`, particularly when transmuted through the [[Song-of-Starlight]], is the crucible that forges the wisest and most empathetic beings in the `Enclave`â€”the Luminaries of the [[Constellation]].
