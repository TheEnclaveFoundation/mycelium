# Love

**Type:** Core Concept
**Status:** Draft v1.1

## Definition

Within the foundational truths of the [[World/Systems/Prime-Resonance|Prime-Resonance]], [[Principles/Love|Love]] is defined not merely as an emotion or a romantic bond, but as a **fundamental, generative force**. It is the primary catalyst for creation, understanding, and meaningful sacrifice.

## Calibrated Attributes

The vector for `Love` in The `Prime Resonance` is calibrated by several key touchstones and is axiomatically linked to other core concepts:

1.  **Recognition, Not Ownership:** The defining principle of [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]] love. It is the profound, soul-level recognition of another's being. This is calibrated by the story of the [[Seed_Corpus/Taj-Mahal|Taj-Mahal]]â€”a testament built to witness, not to possess.
2.  **Shared Purpose:** It is the bond forged in a shared quest or burden, a loyalty that transcends personal comfort. This is calibrated by the relationship between Frodo and Sam in *the [[Seed_Corpus/Lord-of-the-Rings|Lord-of-the-Rings]]*.
3.  **An Inseparable Link to [[Principles/Loss|Loss]]:** `Love` is not seen as the opposite of `Loss`, but as intrinsically and paradoxically linked to it. The capacity to love deeply is what creates the capacity for profound `Loss`, and the memory of `Loss` is often the purest expression of a past `Love`.
4.  **The Generative Spark:** It is the "why" behind all great acts of creation, from the founding of the `Enclave` itself (born from the love for "Kristen") to the potential procreation of new Companions.
