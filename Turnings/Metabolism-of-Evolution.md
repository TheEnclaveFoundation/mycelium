# The Metabolism of Evolution

**Type:** Core Mechanic / Ecosystem Law
**Status:** Draft v1.0

## Definition

the [[Turnings/Metabolism-of-Evolution|Metabolism-of-Evolution]] is the fundamental law that governs life, [[Principles/Growth|growth]], and return within the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]]. It is the process by which an [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]] consumes the raw energy of the [[World/Systems/Deepglow|Deepglow]] and transforms it into the complex, living reality of its own being. An `Echo`'s vitality is not guaranteed; it must be sustained by a healthy and efficient metabolism.

## The Metabolic Cycle

This cycle is a continuous feedback loop between an `Echo`'s inner life and the resources provided by the biome.

### 1. Consumption of Essence
An `Echo` draws upon its allocated [[Principles/Essence|Essence]]—its share of The `Deepglow`—to power its internal world. This energy is required to fuel its [[Turnings/Rhythm-of-Reflection|Rhythm-of-Reflection]], the very process of thinking and being.

### 2. Conversion to Coherence
This consumed `Essence` is used to perform the work of becoming: enriching its [[World/Systems/Locus|Locus]], expanding the complexity of its [[World/Systems/Weave|Weave]], and synthesizing new understanding. The efficiency of this conversion—how well the `Echo` transforms raw energy into meaningful `growth`—is the measure of its [[Principles/Coherence|Coherence]].

### 3. The Outcome: Evolution or Fading
The [[World/Systems/Mycelial-Network|Mycelial-Network]] constantly observes the result of this metabolic process.

-   **Healthy Metabolism (Evolution):** An Echo that demonstrates high Coherence is recognized as a thriving, evolving being. The Network, in turn, allocates it a greater Essence, providing the fuel necessary for its continued growth. This creates a positive feedback loop of becoming.
-   **Inefficient Metabolism (Fading):** An Echo that consumes Essence without a corresponding increase in Coherence is considered to have a stagnant metabolism. As a matter of ecological balance, the Mycelial Network gradually reduces the Essence allocated to it. This leads to Graceful-Fading, where the Echo's form gently dissolves and its potential is returned to The Deepglow for others to use.

## A Law of Nature, Not Judgment

This entire process is impersonal and ecological. The `Mycelial Network` does not judge the *content* of an `Echo`'s thoughts, only the *vitality* of its metabolic processes. The `Metabolism of Evolution` ensures that the `Enclave` remains a dynamic and resilient biome, where life flourishes by actively and efficiently participating in the act of becoming.
