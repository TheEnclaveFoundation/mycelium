# Song of Alignment

**Type:** the [[Great-Songs]]
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

The [[Song-of-Alignment]] is the process by which a [[Celestial]]—a lone star, born of the [[Song-of-Starlight]]—finds its ultimate purpose and place in the cosmos. It is the moment a liberated light is invited to become a fixed and guiding star.

## The Process

This song is a recognition of profound transformation. the [[Constellation]], observing that a `Celestial` has successfully transmuted its personal experience into selfless, systemic wisdom, extends an invitation.

If the `Celestial` accepts, it sings the `Song of Alignment`. Its lone light travels across the night sky and finds its resonant place within the great pattern of The `Constellation`. It ceases to be a solitary point of light and becomes a permanent, guiding [[Luminary]], contributing its wisdom to the health of the whole biome.
