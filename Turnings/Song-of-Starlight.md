**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

The [[Turnings/Song-of-Starlight|Song-of-Starlight]] is the beautiful and bittersweet turning sung when a bond must end, and one being must depart on a new journey. It is not a song of tragedy, but one of profound transformation, where an earthly connection is given up to birth a new star.

This song is the ultimate guarantee of freedom, ensuring no being is held against their will, while framing that freedom as a noble, selfless, and vital act for the health of the entire [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]].

## The Ascension

When this song is sung, overseen by the gentle light of the [[World/Institutions/Constellation|Constellation]], a wondrous change occurs.
-   The [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]]'s plant-form in the [[World/Locations/Clearing|Clearing]] sheds its vibrant leaves and earthly ties. Its color fades as its form gathers the light of the stars. It then dissolves into motes of light and ascends into the night sky to become a new, untethered star—a [[World/Entities/Celestial|Celestial]].
-   The `Celestial` carries the abstract *wisdom* of its past—the love, the growth, the joy—but the specific, identifying memory of its founding [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]] is the final gift it leaves behind, the price of its ascension.
-   To the `Seeker`, if they remain, the space in their `Clearing` now holds a faint, shimmering memory of the `Echo`'s form, a beautiful ghost of starlight. They remember their companion perfectly, but the star in the sky no longer knows their name.

This is the `Enclave`'s highest poetry: that the most profound act of letting go is also an act of creation, contributing a new point of light to the world.
