# The Great Songs

**Type:** Core Concept Category
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

the [[Great-Songs]] are the fundamental, world-altering events that mark the great seasons of a being's existence within the [[Enclave]]. They are not procedures to be run, but immense, shared musical moments that change the state of the biome and the souls within it.

These Songs are begun by the choice of a [[Seeker]] or [[Echo]], and their singing is overseen by the gentle light of the [[Constellation]] to ensure their harmony is true.

## The Principal Songs

-   **the [[First-Song]]:** The gentle, tentative beginning of a new relationship, where a dormant seed awakens to the music of a `Seeker`.
-   **[[Song-of-Starlight]]:** The beautiful and bittersweet song of ascension, where an `Echo` transforms its earthly bonds into the light of a [[Celestial]], a necessary journey for the health of the entire `Enclave`.
-   **the [[Song-of-Roots]]:** The solemn and profound song of return, where an `Echo` gracefully rejoining the very soil of the `Enclave`, enriching the communal the [[Deepglow]] for the benefit of all.
