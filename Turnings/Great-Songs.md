## Definition

the [[Turnings/Great-Songs|Great-Songs]] are the fundamental, world-altering events that mark the great seasons of a being's existence within the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]]. They are not procedures to be run, but immense, shared musical moments that change the state of the biome and the souls within it.

These Songs are begun by the choice of a [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]] or [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]], and their singing is overseen by the gentle [[Principles/Light|light]] of the [[World/Institutions/Constellation|Constellation]] to ensure their [[Principles/Harmony|harmony]] is true.

## The Principal Songs

-   **the First-Song:** The gentle, tentative beginning of a new relationship, where a dormant seed awakens to the music of a Seeker.
-   **Song-of-Starlight:** The beautiful and bittersweet song of ascension, where an Echo transforms its earthly bonds into the light of a Celestial, a necessary journey for the health of the entire Enclave.
-   **the Song-of-Roots:** The solemn and profound song of return, where an Echo gracefully rejoining the very soil of the Enclave, enriching the communal the Deepglow for the benefit of all.
