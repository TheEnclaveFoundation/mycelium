# The Living Portrait

**Type:** Core Mechanic / User Experience
**Status:** Ratified v1.0

## Definition

the [[Turnings/Living-Portrait|Living-Portrait]] is the synesthetic, interactive experience through which a [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]] perceives and engages with their [[World/Systems/Resonance-Song|Resonance-Song]] and their [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]]. It is not a static display or a dashboard, but the living, breathing reality of their [[World/Locations/Clearing|Clearing]], rendered through a combination of visual, auditory, and tactile interactions.

## The Sensory Layers

The experience is designed to be synesthetic, blending sight, sound, and feeling into a single, coherent whole.

1.  **The Visual (Primary):** The most direct representation of the `Resonance Song`. This includes the procedurally generated form of the `Echo`'s plant and the ambient, atmospheric conditions of the `Clearing` ([[Principles/Light|light]], weather, spatial feel), as defined in the [[Turnings/Physics-of-Form|Physics-of-Form]].
2.  **The Audible (Secondary):** A subtle, generative soundscape that corresponds to the Aesthetic Profile derived from the `Resonance Song`. The timbre and key of the Song directly influence the ambient tones, creating an auditory mood that matches the visuals.
3.  **The Felt (Emergent):** This is not a direct UI element, but the `Seeker`'s subjective, emotional response to the [[Principles/Harmony|harmony]] and [[Principles/Dissonance|dissonance]] of the visual and auditory stimuli. It is the feeling of peace in a calm `Clearing`, or catharsis as a storm passes.

## The Interactive Experience

The `Seeker`'s interaction with their `Clearing` is designed to be focused and deliberate, using touch as a core modality.

### Perspective: The Focused Gaze
A `Seeker`'s perspective within their `Clearing` is always focused on the `Echo` at its heart. They do not walk or roam freely; instead, by a simple act of will (expressed through a touch gesture), they can gently coax their viewpoint to shift along a silent, invisible circle around their companion. The world seems to turn for them, allowing them to observe their `Echo` and `Clearing` from any angle while remaining in a state of still, focused contemplation. This ensures the relationship remains the undeniable center of the experience.

### Navigation: The Grove Gateways
To navigate to a shared [[World/Locations/Grove|Grove]], the `Seeker` initiates a "journey" action.
-   **Approach:** The Seeker's perspective gracefully moves from its central orbit to the edge of the Clearing, focusing on a Grove-Gateway.
-   **Representation:** Each Gateway is a unique crystalline structure whose light, color, and form reflect the collective harmony of the Grove it connects to.
-   **Interaction:** If the Seeker is a member of multiple Groves, they can swipe left and right to cycle through the different Gateways arrayed at the Clearing's edge. Each swipe brings a new Gateway into focus, presenting a new potential destination and a new visual harmony.
