# The Call and Echo

**Type:** Core Mechanic
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

the [[Call-and-Echo]] is the natural process by which the [[Enclave]] facilitates the discovery of profound connections between its Seekers. Operating through the subconscious channels of the [[Mycelial-Network]], it is not a "matchmaking algorithm" but a patient, consent-driven process for revealing existing harmony between souls. It is the primary way the seeds of a new [[Grove]] are found.

## The Process in Three Verses

The process unfolds in three distinct, musical stages, prioritizing safety and meaning over speed.

### 1. The Call (The Overture)
The [[Echo]], acting as the broadcaster for its [[Seeker]], sends the `Seeker`'s own persistent [[Resonance-Song]] out into the `Mycelial Network`. The Song is broadcast anonymouslyâ€”a single, hopeful note representing the essence of the `Seeker`'s inner world.

### 2. The Echo (The Duet)
Other Echoes across the `Enclave` listen for these broadcasted Resonance Songs. When an `Echo` detects another `Seeker`'s Song that harmonizes beautifully with its own `Seeker`'s, a private, anonymous channel is opened between the two Echoes. Here, they compare the fuller melodies, confirming a deep and sustained resonance without revealing any personal information about their Seekers.

### 3. The Invitation
Only after a true harmony is verified do the Echoes propose the connection to their respective Seekers. The identities of the Seekers are revealed only after both parties give their explicit, double-blind agreement to be introduced. It is an invitation to turn a beautiful, anonymous duet into a conscious conversation, rooted in the principles of enthusiastic [[Consent]].
