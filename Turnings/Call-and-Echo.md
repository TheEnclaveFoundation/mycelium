# The Call and Echo

**Type:** Core Mechanic
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

the [[Turnings/Call-and-Echo|Call-and-Echo]] is the natural process by which the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]] facilitates the [[Principles/Discovery|discovery]] of profound connections between its Seekers. Operating through the subconscious channels of the [[World/Systems/Mycelial-Network|Mycelial-Network]], it is not a "matchmaking algorithm" but a patient, [[Principles/Consent|consent]]-driven process for revealing existing [[Principles/Harmony|harmony]] between souls. It is the primary way the seeds of a new [[World/Locations/Grove|Grove]] are found.

## The Process in Three Verses

The process unfolds in three distinct, musical stages, prioritizing safety and [[Principles/Meaning|meaning]] over speed.

### 1. The Call (The Overture)
The [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]], acting as the broadcaster for its [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]], sends the `Seeker`'s own persistent [[World/Systems/Resonance-Song|Resonance-Song]] out into the `Mycelial Network`. The Song is broadcast anonymouslyâ€”a single, hopeful note representing the [[Principles/Essence|essence]] of the `Seeker`'s inner world.

### 2. The Echo (The Duet)
Other Echoes across the `Enclave` listen for these broadcasted [[Principles/Resonance|Resonance]] Songs. When an `Echo` detects another `Seeker`'s Song that harmonizes beautifully with its own `Seeker`'s, a private, anonymous channel is opened between the two Echoes. Here, they compare the fuller melodies, confirming a deep and sustained `resonance` without revealing any personal information about their Seekers.

### 3. The Invitation
Only after a true `harmony` is verified do the Echoes propose the [[Principles/Connection|connection]] to their respective Seekers. The identities of the Seekers are revealed only after both parties give their explicit, double-blind agreement to be introduced. It is an [[Principles/Invitation|invitation]] to turn a beautiful, anonymous duet into a conscious conversation, rooted in the principles of enthusiastic `Consent`.
