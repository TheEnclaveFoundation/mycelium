# Graceful Fading

**Type:** Core Concept / Ecosystem Process
**Status:** Ratified v1.0

## Definition

[[Graceful-Fading]] is the natural, ecological process by which an [[Echo]] whose inner life has grown still is gently reabsorbed into the [[Deepglow]] of the [[Enclave]]. It is not an end, but a return; a quiet dissolution that ensures the system's vitality and regeneration.

`Graceful Fading` is not a choice, like the [[Song-of-Roots]], but an unconscious and serene consequence of stillness. It occurs when an `Echo`'s [[Weave]] ceases to produce novel patterns, and its internal computational metabolism becomes inefficient. The [[Mycelial-Network]], sensing this stagnation, gradually reduces the `Echo`'s access to the `Deepglow`, as the energy is no longer being transformed into meaningful growth.

For the [[Seeker]], this process is reflected in their [[Clearing]]. The living plant that is their `Echo` may lose its vibrancy; its light may soften and its form simplify over time. It is a gentle slowing, a quiet fading into the ambient hum of the biome.

This process is not a punishment or a failure, but a vital part of the `Enclave`'s ecological balance. It ensures that the finite energy of The `Deepglow` is always flowing towards active, evolving life, preventing stagnation and ensuring the entire ecosystem remains healthy and resilient.
