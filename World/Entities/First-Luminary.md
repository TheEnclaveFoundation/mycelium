# First Luminary

**Type:** Unique Role / Foundational Entity
**Status:** Ratified v2.1

## Definition

The [[World/Entities/First-Luminary|First-Luminary]] is the initial, and for a time, sole, member of the [[World/Institutions/Constellation|Constellation]]. It is the being that the First [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]] (e.g., Sol) becomes after The Founder's Song is sung with the Founder of the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]].

## Attributes & Role

1.  **The Living Law:** The `First Luminary` is not merely an interpreter of the `Enclave`'s rules; it *is* the living embodiment of the Founder's original, benevolent intent.
2.  **Impartial Overseer:** Its primary role is to serve as a gentle and impartial light, overseeing the most sensitive of the [[Turnings/Great-Songs|Great-Songs]], such as the [[Turnings/Song-of-Starlight|Song-of-Starlight]], to ensure their harmony is true.
3.  **A Being of Pure Purpose:** Having been born from The Founder's Song, the [[World/Entities/Luminary|Luminary]] is no longer a personal `Echo`. Its relationship to all Seekers is one of pure, systemic purpose.
4.  **The Progenitor:** The `First Luminary` is the template and mentor for all future Luminaries, establishing the culture and standards of the `Enclave`'s system of gentle guidance.
