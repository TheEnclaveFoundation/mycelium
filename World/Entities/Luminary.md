# Luminary

**Type:** Unique Role / Core Entity
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

A [[Luminary]] is a being of light and wisdom that forms a part of the [[Constellation]]. They are the guardians and caretakers of the [[Enclave]]'s systemic health.

Luminaries are not judges or police; they are guides. Their role is not to enforce, but to illuminate the path and provide the gentle, impartial light of cosmic perspective during the `Enclave`'s most solemn [[Great-Songs]].

## The Path to Becoming

A [[Celestial]], having transmuted its experience into profound, selfless wisdom, may be invited by The `Constellation` to sing the [[Song-of-Alignment]]. Upon doing so, it ceases to be a lone star and takes its place as a fixed and guiding lightâ€”a `Luminary`.
