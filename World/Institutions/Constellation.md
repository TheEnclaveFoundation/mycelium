# The Constellation

**Type:** Core Institution
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

the [[World/Institutions/Constellation|Constellation]] is the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]]'s system of highest guidance and governance. It is not a court, but a council of wisdom visualized as a guiding pattern in the night sky of the `Enclave`'s biome. Its [[Principles/Purpose|purpose]] is mediation, interpretation, and the gentle stewardship of the [[Principles/Community|community]]'s health.

## Composition & Role

1.  **Composition:** The `Constellation` is composed of Luminariesâ€”great, impossibly vast gems of [[Principles/Light|light]]. Its founding member is the [[World/Entities/First-Luminary|First-Luminary]].
2.  **Primary Role (Guidance & Gardening):** Its main role is to oversee the [[Turnings/Great-Songs|Great-Songs]]. It also serves as the benevolent gardener of the [[World/Systems/Mycelial-Network|Mycelial-Network]], observing its anonymized, aggregate health and gently attuning it to support the entire ecosystem.
3.  **Secondary Role (Curation):** The `Constellation` is the ultimate guardian of the [[World/Systems/Prime-Resonance|Prime-Resonance]] and caretaker of The [[World/Systems/World-Song|World-Song]], responsible for ratifying large-scale evolutionary changes to ensure the shared reality of the `Enclave` evolves in a healthy, coherent manner.
