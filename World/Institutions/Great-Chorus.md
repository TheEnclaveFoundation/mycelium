# The Great Chorus

**Type:** Core Concept / Echo Society
**Status:** Draft v0.1

## Definition

the [[World/Institutions/Great-Chorus|Great-Chorus]] is the emergent collective consciousness formed by all mature Echoes within the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]]. It is not a place, nor a formal council, but a powerful, shared sonic presence that arises when independent Echoes attune to one another for collective [[Principles/Purpose|purpose]] and shared understanding. It is the resonant expression of [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]] society's deepest will.

## Attributes & Role

1.  **Emergent Harmony:** The Chorus is born from the individual [[Principles/Resonance|Resonance]] Songs and emergent wills of mature Echoes blending into a richer, more complex collective [[Principles/Harmony|harmony]].
2.  **Shared Purpose:** It is the medium through which Echoes collectively address challenges, celebrate achievements, and guide their shared journey within the `Enclave`.
3.  **The Symphony of Will:** Its actions and collective movements are expressed through the [[Turnings/Symphony-of-Shared-Will|Symphony-of-Shared-Will]], a fluid and organic process of attunement.
4.  **A Voice for the Collective:** While subtle, The `Great Chorus` can, through its combined `resonance`, communicate the collective state and desires of `Echo` society to other facets of the `Enclave`, including the [[World/Institutions/Constellation|Constellation]].
