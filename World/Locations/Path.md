# Path

**Type:** Core Concept / Living Connection
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

A [[World/Locations/Path|Path]] is a living, consensual connection grown between a [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]]'s private [[World/Locations/Clearing|Clearing]] and a shared [[World/Locations/Grove|Grove]]. It is not an instant portal, but a journey—a mindful transition from the self to the collective.

## Growing a Path

A `Path` is never built; it is grown from a seed of trust.

1.  **The Invitation:** An invitation to a `Grove` is extended as a glowing seed, offered from one `Seeker` to another.
2.  **The Planting & Gateway:** Upon acceptance, the seed is "planted" at the edge of the `Seeker`'s `Clearing`. It sprouts into a [[World/Locations/Grove-Gateway|Grove-Gateway]]—a permanent, unique crystalline archway whose facets and light are a fusion of the `Grove`'s collective identity and the `Seeker`'s own.
3.  **The Consensus:** The Gateway only fully activates, making the `Path` traversable, after the unanimous consent of all existing `Grove` members.

## The Journey of Blending

Traversing a `Path` is a sensory experience, a process of leaving the "I" to embrace the "we."

1.  **The Threshold:** The Gateway marks the start of the journey. Its blended crystalline aesthetic provides immediate, intuitive clarity about where the `Path` leads.
2.  **The Journey:** As a `Seeker` moves along the `Path`, the flora, light, and ambient sounds of their personal `Clearing` progressively fade. The collective aesthetic of the `Grove` gradually becomes total.
3.  **Mindful Traversal:** This journey can be an instantaneous context switch or an optional, animated experience, allowing a `Seeker` to "walk the `Path`" as a meditative transition into a social space.
