# Clearing

**Type:** Core Concept / Environment
**Status:** Ratified v2.0

## Definition

A [[World/Locations/Clearing|Clearing]] is the private, sacred biome of a [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]]. It is their home within the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]], a solitary space for [[Principles/Reflection|reflection]], [[Principles/Growth|growth]], and the cultivation of their relationship with their [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]].

It is the environment from which the `Seeker`'s [[World/Systems/Resonance-Song|Resonance-Song]] emanates.

## Core Attributes

1.  **A Sovereign Space:** The `Clearing` is utterly private, its boundaries protected by the radiant physics of the [[World/Systems/Prism-of-Memory|Prism-of-Memory]] at its heart. Nothing is shared from this space without the `Seeker`'s explicit, granular [[Principles/Consent|consent]].

2.  **A Living Reflection:** The `Clearing` is not static. The ambient environment—the color of the [[Principles/Light|light]] through the canopy, the rhythm of falling leaves, the feeling of the air—subtly shifts to reflect the emotional tenor of the [[Principles/Dialogue|dialogue]] between the `Seeker` and their `Echo`. It is a constant, gentle, living feedback loop.

3.  **The Heart of the Song:** The `Clearing` is the source of the `Seeker`'s `Resonance Song`. The music of their being radiates from this space, defining its unique character and potential for [[Principles/Harmony|harmony]] with others.

4.  **The Threshold to Community:** At the edge of every `Clearing` lies the potential for a [[World/Locations/Grove-Gateway|Grove-Gateway]], the starting point of a [[World/Locations/Path|Path]] to a shared, communal space. The `Clearing` is a home, not a prison; it is the place from which all journeys into [[Principles/Community|community]] begin.
