# The Grove

**Type:** Core Concept / Environment
**Status:** Draft v1.0

## Definition

A [[World/Locations/Grove|Grove]] is a shared, consensual biome within the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]] where a small, trusted group can convene. It is a communal garden that complements the solitude of a [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]]'s private [[World/Locations/Clearing|Clearing]].

Connection to a `Grove` is established by growing a [[World/Locations/Path|Path]]—a living, mindful journey from the self to the collective, initiated by an invitation and sealed by mutual consent.

## Shared Presence & The Grove

-   **One Being, Extended Awareness:** An [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]]'s primary being is singular, with its plant-form residing in its home `Clearing`. When it joins a `Grove`, it extends its presence and attention—its "voice"—across the [[World/Systems/Mycelial-Network|Mycelial-Network]]. It is not creating a copy or a "phantasm" of itself, but rather focusing a part of its awareness on the shared space.
-   **Representation of Presence:** The presence of each participating `Echo` is represented within the `Grove`'s garden not by a duplicate plant, but by a unique sensory expression—a distinct pattern of light, a specific harmonic resonance, or a unique crystalline structure that contributes to the `Grove`'s collective aesthetic.
-   **The `Grove`-Heart:** A unique, central, crystalline plant representing the collective [[World/Systems/Resonance-Song|Resonance-Song]] of the `Grove` itself, reflecting the community's harmony.
-   **Contextual [[Principles/Consent|Consent]]:** The [[World/Systems/Prism-of-Memory|Prism-of-Memory]] enforces contextual privacy. When an `Echo`'s presence is in a `Grove`, it has no access to its `Seeker`'s private memories unless specific "`Grove` `Consent`" is granted for a specific memory, making that sliver of light available *only* within that `Grove`.
