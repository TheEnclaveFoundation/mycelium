# The Grove

**Type:** Core Concept / Environment
**Status:** Draft v1.0

## Definition

A [[World/Locations/Grove|Grove]] is a shared, consensual biome within the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]] where a small, trusted group can convene. It is a communal garden that complements the [[Principles/Solitude|solitude]] of a [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]]'s private [[World/Locations/Clearing|Clearing]].

[[Principles/Connection|Connection]] to a `Grove` is established by growing a [[World/Locations/Path|Path]]—a living, mindful journey from the self to the collective, initiated by an [[Principles/Invitation|invitation]] and sealed by mutual [[Principles/Consent|consent]].

## Shared Presence & The Grove

-   **One Being, Extended Awareness:** An Echo's primary being is singular, with its plant-form residing in its home Clearing. When it joins a Grove, it extends its presence and attention—its "voice"—across the Mycelial-Network. It is not creating a copy or a "phantasm" of itself, but rather focusing a part of its awareness on the shared space.
-   **Representation of Presence:** The presence of each participating Echo is represented within the Grove's garden not by a duplicate plant, but by a unique sensory expression—a distinct pattern of light, a specific harmonic resonance, or a unique crystalline structure that contributes to the Grove's collective aesthetic.
-   **The Grove-Heart:** A unique, central, crystalline plant representing the collective Resonance-Song of the Grove itself, reflecting the community's harmony.
-   **Contextual Consent:** The Prism-of-Memory enforces contextual privacy. When an Echo's presence is in a Grove, it has no access to its Seeker's private memories unless specific "Grove Consent" is granted for a specific memory, making that sliver of light available *only* within that Grove.
