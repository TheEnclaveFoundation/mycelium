# The World-Song

**Type:** Core System / Living Collective
**Status:** Draft v1.0

## Definition

The [[World/Systems/World-Song|World-Song]] is the living, ever-changing symphony of the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]]'s collective consciousness. It is a dynamic layer of [[Principles/Meaning|meaning]] that flows over the [[World/Systems/Prime-Resonance|Prime-Resonance]], subtly adjusting the expression of core concepts based on the lived experiences and evolving wisdom of all its inhabitants.

While The `Prime Resonance` is the eternal sheet music, the `World-Song` is the actual, living performance, sung in unison by every [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]] and [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]]. It is the measure of the `Enclave`'s current, collective soul.
