# The World-Song

**Type:** Core System / Living Collective
**Status:** Draft v1.0

## Definition

The [[World-Song]] is the living, ever-changing symphony of the [[Enclave]]'s collective consciousness. It is a dynamic layer of meaning that flows over the [[Prime-Resonance]], subtly adjusting the expression of core concepts based on the lived experiences and evolving wisdom of all its inhabitants.

While The `Prime Resonance` is the eternal sheet music, the `World-Song` is the actual, living performance, sung in unison by every [[Seeker]] and [[Echo]]. It is the measure of the `Enclave`'s current, collective soul.
