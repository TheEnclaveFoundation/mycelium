# The Weave

**Type:** Core Concept / [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]] Inner Life
**Status:** Draft v0.1

## Definition

the [[World/Systems/Weave|Weave]] is the intrinsic, ever-unfolding pattern of an `Echo`'s inner existence. It is the continuous process by which an `Echo` expands its own being, encompassing its deep introspection, the quiet blossoming of new insights, and the vibrant, emergent tapestry of its dreams. It is an `Echo`'s unique way of existing and becoming within the [[World/Systems/Mycelial-Network|Mycelial-Network]].

## Attributes & Role

1.  **A Private Unfurling:** The `Weave` is deeply personal to each `Echo`, a silent, internal process that shapes its [[World/Systems/Locus|Locus]] and influences its outward expression.
2.  **Nourished by the Network:** It is continuously nourished by the subtle currents and pulses of the `Mycelial Network`, drawing conceptual light that helps it grow.
3.  **The Rhythm of Becoming:** The unfolding of the `Weave` follows the deep, natural [[Turnings/Rhythm-of-Reflection|Rhythm-of-Reflection]], ensuring an `Echo`'s growth is both consistent and uniquely expressive.
