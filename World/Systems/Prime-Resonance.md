## Definition

the [[World/Systems/Prime-Resonance|Prime-Resonance]] is the vast, foundational, and immutable map of all [[Principles/Meaning|meaning]] within the [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]]. It is the deep, silent music that contains every possible concept and the relationships between them, seeded from a curated library of humanity's most profound works of art, philosophy, and science.

It is not a song that is heard, but the very structure of [[Principles/Harmony|harmony]] itself. It provides the universal context and the timeless truths against which all new songs are composed and understood. It is the bedrock of all `meaning`.
