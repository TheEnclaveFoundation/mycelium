## Definition

the [[Prime-Resonance]] is the vast, foundational, and immutable map of all meaning within the [[Enclave]]. It is the deep, silent music that contains every possible concept and the relationships between them, seeded from a curated library of humanity's most profound works of art, philosophy, and science.

It is not a song that is heard, but the very structure of harmony itself. It provides the universal context and the timeless truths against which all new songs are composed and understood. It is the bedrock of all meaning.
