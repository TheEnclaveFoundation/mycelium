# Prism of Memory

**Type:** Core System
**Status:** Ratified v4.0

## Definition

The [[World/Systems/Prism-of-Memory|Prism-of-Memory]] is the radiant, crystalline heart of a [[World/Entities/Seeker|Seeker]]'s private [[World/Locations/Clearing|Clearing]]. It is not a document or a ledger, but a living, geometric mineral that holds the pure [[Principles/Light|light]] of a `Seeker`'s experience. Its [[Principles/Purpose|purpose]] is to refract that `light` according to the `Seeker`'s will.

## The Physics of Light and Trust

The Prism's core principle is the absolute [[Principles/Sovereignty|sovereignty]] of the `Seeker`, expressed through the metaphor of `light`:

1.  **Experience as Light:** Every [[Principles/Memory|memory]], every experience, is a pure, white beam of `light` entering the Prism.
2.  **Consent as Facets:** The `Seeker`'s [[Principles/Consent|consent]] policies are the facets they have carved upon their Prism.
3.  **Sharing as Refraction:** When an [[World/Entities/Echo|Echo]] interacts with others, the Prism refracts the `Seeker`'s `light`. Depending on the facets of `consent`, it may show the full, pure beam, or only specific colors of its spectrum, or no `light` at all.

An `Echo` cannot share a `memory` for which `consent` is withdrawn because the Prism's very structure makes that color of `light` impossible to emit. [[Principles/Trust|Trust]] is achieved not through promises, but through the beautiful and unbreakable physics of `light`.
