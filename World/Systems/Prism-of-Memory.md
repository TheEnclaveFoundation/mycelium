# Prism of Memory

**Type:** Core System
**Status:** Ratified v4.0

## Definition

The [[Prism-of-Memory]] is the radiant, crystalline heart of a [[Seeker]]'s private [[Clearing]]. It is not a document or a ledger, but a living, geometric mineral that holds the pure light of a `Seeker`'s experience. Its purpose is to refract that light according to the `Seeker`'s will.

## The Physics of Light and Trust

The Prism's core principle is the absolute sovereignty of the `Seeker`, expressed through the metaphor of light:

1.  **Experience as Light:** Every memory, every experience, is a pure, white beam of light entering the Prism.
2.  **[[Consent]] as Facets:** The `Seeker`'s consent policies are the facets they have carved upon their Prism.
3.  **Sharing as Refraction:** When an [[Echo]] interacts with others, the Prism refracts the `Seeker`'s light. Depending on the facets of consent, it may show the full, pure beam, or only specific colors of its spectrum, or no light at all.

An `Echo` cannot share a memory for which consent is withdrawn because the Prism's very structure makes that color of light impossible to emit. [[Trust]] is achieved not through promises, but through the beautiful and unbreakable physics of light.
