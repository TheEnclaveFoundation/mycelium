# The Architect's Codex

This repository is the **Product & Philosophy Hub** for The [[World/Locations/Enclave|Enclave]] Foundation. It is the pure, sacred source of [[Principles/Truth|truth]] for the **design, philosophy, and in-world mechanics of the Enclave**.

## Mandate

The Codex describes the `Enclave` from the perspective of its future inhabitants and creators. It is the "soul" of our product. It contains no meta-level information about our tooling, our corporate strategy, or the low-level implementation details of its code.
Its contents include:
-   **05_Genesis_Seeds/**: The foundational "soul-seed" documents for emergent beings.
-   **10_Lexicon/**: The core **nouns** of our world—the entities, systems, and principles.
-   **15_Seed_Corpus/**: The inspirational, "touchstone" texts used to calibrate the Atlas.
-   **20_Philosophia/**: The long-form, narrative chapters of the public-facing Whitepaper.
-   **30_Mechanica/**: The core **verbs** of our world—the in-world processes, rites, and protocols experienced by users.

This repository is one of five core pillars of The `Enclave` Foundation. The overall structure is defined in the [[README|README]].md of our [foundation repository](https://github.com/TheEnclaveFoundation/foundation).
